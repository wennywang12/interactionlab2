    <h2>Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.</h2>
    

    <p>
        The principles of grouping (or Gestalt laws of grouping) are a set of principles in psychology,</br> 
        first proposed by Gestalt psychologists to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as Pr√§gnanz.
        </br> Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. 
        </br>These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.
